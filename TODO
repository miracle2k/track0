Currently, urls returning error codes are ignored. We might want to implement
these as implicit default tests, i.e. -code>=400, such that a user may override
this using +code=404.

Consider a mode in which all redirects are saved as http-equiv=refresh
files. Possible via something like "@save +redirect".

Handling redirects: Consider having a mode where the source url (the url
doing the redirect) does not need to pass @follow. This would however
entail a HEAD request for every url encountered to determine that it is
a redirect.

Currently all redirects are saved under the target name. And argument can
be made that for temporary redirects, the source name should be used. The
problem is that this would be really unhelpful for things like a
download.php redirect. Possibly interesting things with looking at mimetpes
(say: seeing if they are the same) could work.

Think about how to handle content-disposition headers.
